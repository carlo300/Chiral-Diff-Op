abstract={These notes are an informal introduction to algebras of chiral differential operators. The language used is one of vertex algebras, otherwise the approach chosen is that suggested by Beilinson and Drinfeld. The prerequisites are kept to a minimum, and we even give an informal introduction to the Beilinson-Bernstein localization theory in the example of the projective line.},
